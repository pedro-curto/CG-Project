# How to run

First, clone the project:

`git clone https://github.com/pedro-curto/CG-Project.git`

Navigate to this directory:

`cd deliveryB/code/`

Then, start a live server. You can either use VSCode's live server extension (what I used), or, for example, install Node.js's live-server:

`npm install -g live-server`

And then start it:

`live-server`

You can then access it on your browser at `localhost:8080/`.

The keys for each feature are in the top left corner. You can check more details at the statement.pdf in the previous directory.

Have fun!
