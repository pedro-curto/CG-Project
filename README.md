# CG-Project
## Description
Welcome! This is a project that I made in a group of 3, for the Computer Graphics (CG @IST) class in the year academic year 2023/2024. There were three deliveries:

- In the first delivery, we simply had to draw some basic Technical Drawings and Scene Graphs of a crane and a carrousel, that we would later implement in deliveries B and C, respectively

- In the second delivery, we implemented the crane using THREEjs; you can play with it locally, if you follow the instructions for deliveryB

- In the third delivery, we implemented the carrousel using THREEjs; similarly, you can play with it locally, if you follow the instructions for deliveryC

Hope you enjoy it as much as I did doing it!
